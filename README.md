## 7. Celebrate - you've done your first pull request!!!!!

```py
'''
Always make more than 4 pull requests.
Let's say, you have made only 4 pull requests to different projects,
but one of them got excluded from hackoctoberfest event. Then, your pull request is no longer counted and you have remaining 3 valid pull requests (if these projects are not excluded).
If you fail to make a total of 4 pull requests then you can't get swags or t-shirts.
I will recommend you to make pull requests to your own repository, which is the safest option for you..
Make sure that the repo has hacktoberfest topic..
